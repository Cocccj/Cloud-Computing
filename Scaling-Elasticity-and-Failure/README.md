# Scaling, Elasticity and Failure

### Horizontal Scaling

Used cloud APIs(both AWS and Azure) to programmatically control resources in response to demand. Configured and deployed an Elastic Load Balancer along with an Auto Scaling Group on AWS.


### Load Balancing

Developed load balancing algorithms to monitor data centers, assigned threads to check the connections and replace the unhealthy instances.


### Caching

Implemented Least Recently Used cache algorithm in the front end, for both temporal locality and spatial locality.
