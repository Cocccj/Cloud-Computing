### Social Networking Timeline with Heterogeneous Backends

Built a social network for movies, implemented user authentication and profile management with MySQL, stored social graph using HBase and stored the posts using MongoDB, and also implemented a recommendation system which recommend friends to a user with the Friend-of-friend strategy.


### OLAP with Cloud Data Warehousing

Designed and implemented cloud data warehouse to store sales transaction records with three databases: Hive, Impala, Redshift. Used caching techniques and partitioned the data, and also optimized the queries to reduce processing time.
